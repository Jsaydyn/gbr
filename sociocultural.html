How Does Tourism Benefit Sociocultural Systems Around The Reef?
	</h1>
<p class = "info">
    Tourism in the Great Barrier Reef provides a variety of beneficial sociocultural effects to the local community. It connects people of different cultures and languages together and allows multiculturalism in the community. This means that communities should work hard to allow for these diverse groups of people to visit the Reef. Tourism in these regions also decreases social issues such as discrimination.

    What disadvantages does it create and what is the response?
</h1>
<p class = "info">
    There are also a variety of issues to sociocultural systems that come with tourism. Firstly, tourism can dilute local cultures. The Great Barrier Reef and surrounding regions have a rich Indigenous Australian significance that may be threatened by local communities which may encourage the culture of different tourists. Tourism can also provide health issues to local communities, such as spreading disease. Tourism was one of the main factors which allowed COVID-19 to spread throughout the country. As a response to this, the Government closed domestic and international borders to prevent tourists from spreading disease. This response has worked, as graphs show that banning travel has slowed the spread of Coronavirus.
