	Tourism & <br>The Economy
	</h1>
    <p class = "headerinfo">
        Tourism generates a large sum of income for workers in and surrounding the Great Barrier Reef. Services such as hotels, cruises, tours and activities such as kayaking all are crucial contributions to the economy of the reef. However, relying on a single industry to maintain a healthy economy can be risky.

    How Does Tourism Contribute to the economy?
        </h1>
    <p class = "info">
        Tourism is a major source for the income that the Great Barrier Reef receives and how it contributes to the Australian economy. Accommodation, tours, activities and souvenirs all contribute to the economy of the region. In total The Great Barrier Reef generates around 6.4 billion dollars a year, making it one of Australiaâ€™s biggest industries and also going towards the funding of different <a href = "https://vltava7.github.io/gbr/environmental.html" class="normal">environmental campaigns.</a> The tourism industry in The Great Barrier Reef employs around 64,000 people.

        What are the risks of relying on tourism?
    </h1>
    <p class = "info">
Tourism parks, hotels and cruises cost a lot of money to maintain, and an event such as COVID-19 lockdowns can cause these businesses to use up a lot of money without making as much profits. As a response to these issues, these industries prioritised domestic tourism and offered special discounts in order to attract more local customers and maximise profit in a time like this. This response has worked overall since statistics show that the hotel industry has managed to remain steady throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
