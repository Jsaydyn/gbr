        Tourism has had a significant impact on the natural environment in and around the reef. While these are mostly negative, there are some positive effects that may not be as apparent.

How Does Tourism Detriment The Reef?
	</h1>
<p class = "info">
Over the past decade, tourism was one of the main problems that resulted in the percentage decrease of marine life living in the great barrier reef. 50% of the coral reef has died, mostly because of tourism.Although we cannot shut down tourism in the great barrier reef, we can reduce the impacts of tourism by letting fewer people in and setting boundaries for things tourists can and cannot do. Another tourist problem is that tourists can accidentally step on corals and break them, causing them to die.'

<h1>
    How Does Tourism Benefit The Reef?
</h1>
<p class = "info">
Things tourism helps with is that a significant amount of money generated from tourism goes to funding the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. An example of a way a group has responded is a method of coral repopulation. Eggs of corals are collected from healthy reefs to be grown in special enclosures and tanks. Once they are fully grown, the corals are placed in endangered reefs in order to keep the population of corals up. This is a great strategy for reviving the great barrier reef, but a disadvantage of this strategy is that corals only reproduce once every year, after a full moon. If there is a reef that is in need of urgent care, they might not be able to do anything if it is Winter or Autumn.
